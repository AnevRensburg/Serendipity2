# Serendipity Storage - Demo

This is a demo website for Serendipity Storage, a storage cabinet supplying business. 

[Demo Website](https://anevrensburg.github.io/serendipity-demo/)

I have designed and implemented this demo website using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. 

My approach avoids the use of website generators like WordPress and CMS platforms, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills effectively. These sites are reactive and present well on all mobile devices as well as full-sized computer screens.

**After some changes, the website went live in February 2023 and is currently in use:**
